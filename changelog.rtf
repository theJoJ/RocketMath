Nov 14, 2016:

The program now has 2 methods: add2nums and sub2nums. Their functions are 
pretty obvious -_-.

Also, I added a third variable, c, as the choice variable. c will be used
in a if-else statement, which will determine wich of the two functions
will be used.

That's all for now...

(Same day:)

So I added a third function, a function that divides two numbers. \I also modified the main() 
function to have a third option for division.
